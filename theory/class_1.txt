1) What is Emmet?

Ans. Emmet is a Web-Developer's toolkit to imporve the Html and Css workflow.When you type Css-like or HTML-like expression. Emmet will 
 dynamically phrase your abrevation and gernate a "snippet" (re-usable chunk of code) based on the abrevation we typed. It is mostly 
 used in the HTML, XML and CSS, but we can use it for other programming languages.

 some commonly used expressions:

 html:5 for generting a html boilerplate.
 h1 + h2 + p + div +... for generting sibling html elements.
 div>h1>.. gor generting childs.

 2) What is the difference between a Libray and Framework?

Libray : A Libray is a pre-written code that is used to simplity the task.It is a set of pre-functions and classes that a developer 
can re-use to simplity a task. Here the control lies with the devloper when to call and where to call a libray in his code.

Framework : A Framework provides a foundation to build a application for a platform. It has a pre-written pieases code which will
 performs a common task and uses the code provided by the developer for the custom functionality.

Key difference :- Inverse of control (IoC), By using libray you have the control over the flow of the program. The libray can be called 
by a devloper whenever and whereever needed. Where as incase of Framework it's Frameworks code that will call our code.

3) What is a CDN? why do we use CDN it?

CDN (Common Delivery Network) it is a system of distributed servers that delivers the webcontent to a user based on the 
geographical location.

4) why react is called as react?

React is developed developed for the applications that has costantly changing data. Since react is used as View in 
the MVC. that means when user clicks and changes the application data. The view should "React" or change the application
events for those users.

5) what is the use of crossorigin in script tag?

To know about crossorin in script tag, we need to understand about CORS.

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a HTTP-Header based mechanism that allows a Server to indicate any origins (domain) except it's own from which a browser 
should permit the resource loading.Or in another way we can defined it as mechanism in which the browser will do a "Preflight" request to server which is hosted in the 
the cross-orgin resources and check weather that host will permit the request, I will be done by passing the HTTP- Method  and the header of the actual request.

Here In our case we are tring to access the web-content (resources) from CDN. which is hosted in a different domain. To access the resources we are using crossorigin
attribute in script tag. crossorigin specifies that the CORS is support when the while loading the we-content from the CDN.No credentials are passed while retriving the 
resources.

6) what is the difference between the React and ReactDOM?

    InOrder to work with React in browser (ReactJS). we need to we need to include two libraies:
    1. React (React Libray is responsible for creating views).
    2. ReactDOM (ReactDOM Libray is responsible for actual rendering of the UI in the browser).

7) what is the difference between the react.development.js and react.production.js files Via CDN?

1) react.development.js is for development purpuse only. It is not that optimized. It will be good for learning and for project developemts.
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

2) react.production.js is for the production purpuse. It is optimized and minified. I will be faster when compared to development one.
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>


8) what is the difference between async and defer?

async and defer are the boolean attributes which are used to used in the script tag. to load external script efficently.

Incase of async the scripts are fetched asynchornously along with the HTML parse ing, once the scripts are loading is done. the it will stop the HTML parsing 
and starts execution of the scrpits loaded. once the scripts are executed fully. then it will contines the HTML parsing.
It won't guaranties the order of execution of the scripts as the first come first executed.
It is ideal for the modular and independent scripts loading.

Incase of defer the scripts are fetched asynchornously along with the HTML parseing, but scrpits will executed only the HTML parseing is done fully.
It will guaranties the order of execution of the scrpits. as all the scripts are executed at the end.
It is Ideal for the dependent scripts loading.
